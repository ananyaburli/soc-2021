# SoC-2021
This is a repository of my work in the Summer of Code project in Tools for Data Science, 2021.

The repository contains three task submissions as well as a notebook of the final self project. The final self project is supplemented by images and csv's of results generated throughout the same.

Task-1: linear regression and use of basic libraries

Task-2: more complex regression problems

Task-3: PCA and supervised classification-based problems

CDD-project: Final project folder, based on Computational Drug Discovery.
