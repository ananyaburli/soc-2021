# SoC-2021
This is a repository of my work in the Summer of Code project in Tools for Data Science, 2021. The project on Computational Drug Discovery deals with the regression model building to predict IC50 values of drug-like compounds used to target a biomarker Anoctamin-1 in breast cancer. Statistical test is performed to gauge the differences between active and inactive compounds (based on Lipinski's rule of five). The pIC50 value has then been used as a target variable for testing various supervised learning models on the dataset on compounds. The dataset has been obtained from ChemBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/).

The repository contains three task submissions as well as a notebook of the final self project. The final self project is supplemented by images and csv's of results generated throughout the same.

Task-1: linear regression and use of basic libraries. Submitted on April 10 [Before of Checkpoint 1]. (Original submission: https://github.com/Tools-For-Data-Science-SOC/tasks/blob/main/task1/Pinaapple_Sluts/task1.ipynb)

Task-2: more complex regression problems. Submitted on May 13 [Before of Checkpoint 2] (Original submission: https://github.com/Tools-For-Data-Science-SOC/tasks/blob/main/task2/Pineapple_People/task2.ipynb)

Task-3: PCA and supervised classification-based problems. Submitted on May 30 [Before of Checkpoint 2] (Original submission: https://github.com/Tools-For-Data-Science-SOC/tasks/blob/main/task3/Pineapple_People/task3.ipynb)

CDD-project: Final project folder, based on Computational Drug Discovery. Submitted on 17 July [Before Checkpoint 3]

  The CDD-project folder contains an image folder which further contains images of various plot-based results.
  
  The folder also contains a folder of the various dataframes stored as CSVs for carrying the data forward in different contexts and as a useful reference.
  
  The .smi file contains the mapping of the canonical smiles representation of the compounds to their ChemBL IDs.
